## My Hobbies

### 🎮 Gaming
I enjoy playing RPGs. My favorite is *The Legend of Zelda*. I'm pretty good at solving puzzles and love immersive worlds. Currently playing *Wuthering Waves* and *Honkai Star Rail*.

### 🖼️ Drawing
I draw digital art in my free time using Procreate. It's relaxing and helps me express my creativity.

###  🎶 Music
I play 3–4 times a week. It keeps me healthy and clears my mind.
